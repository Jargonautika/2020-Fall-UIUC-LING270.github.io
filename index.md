## Course Overview

This course deals with the interrelated nature of language, technology, and society. We discuss the invention of writing as a language technology and how that gave rise to a series of cultural revolutions. We tackle the nature of society and what it means to be a social group, a social world. We will then move on to discuss language technologies such as the telegraph and discuss their impact on history. Finally, we will utilize the internet as a means by which we can re-evaluate our language and its impact on society on a global scale.

## Course Objectives

The main goal of this course is to excite an interest for and passion in language technologies in the attentive student. 

While many of us know a variety of things about some aspects of language technologies like Siri or Alexa, this course should expound upon what you already know and garner a greater appreciation for the amazing resources available to this generation. 

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
* Logically discuss the origins of the world's various writing systems
* Understand and analyze the efficacy of various methods of transliteration, transcription, and translation used to go from one writing system to another
* Posit theoretical advancements to current language technologies and their potential to impact society
* Recognize the difficulty involved in the creation of new language technology, and how such challenges can be overcome
	 
**Please note: _this course is not a technical class_**. You will not be taught how to develop a natural language processing (NLP) system, or an AI system. However, we will be discussing the current state of research NLP and AI in broad strokes (among many other language technologies). If you are interested in these areas, the aim of this course is to give you a high-level survey of these fields and discuss the social significance of language technologies.
